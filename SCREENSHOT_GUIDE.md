# 📸 How to Add Screenshots to README

## Step 1: Create Screenshots Folder

In your project root (same level as README.md), create a folder named `screenshots`

## Step 2: Save Your Screenshots

Save these images in the `screenshots` folder with these exact names:

1. **submit_application.png** - The submit application page with emerald theme
2. **ai_review_details.png** - Application details and AI assessments section
3. **ai_review_income.png** - Income assessment section
4. **ai_review_expense.png** - Expense assessment section  
5. **ai_recommendation.png** - The AI recommendation card with decision
6. **all_workflows.png** - The workflows dashboard

## Step 3: Folder Structure Should Look Like:

```
your-project/
├── screenshots/
│   ├── submit_application.png
│   ├── ai_review_details.png
│   ├── ai_review_income.png
│   ├── ai_review_expense.png
│   ├── ai_recommendation.png
│   └── all_workflows.png
├── README.md
├── backend/
├── frontend/
└── ...
```

## Step 4: README is Already Updated!

The README.md file has been updated to reference these screenshots. Once you add the images to the `screenshots` folder, they will display automatically on GitHub!
